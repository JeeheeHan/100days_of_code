# Day 1 learnings:
Good to knows:<br>
- Hashtables are parent of Python Dictionaries
- Bits = 2 possibilities (0 or 1)
- Byte = 8 bits to encode a single character of text
- ASCII encoding has 128 characters numbered from 0-127
- Python 3 strings are actually encoded Unicode which has a lot more characters. well to rep all characters in every languages
- UTF-16 vs UTF-32: Diff in character space storing
- UTF-8 uses 1 byte per character for ASCII but can vary in bytes per character past that
- ASCII = American Standard Code For Information Interchange
- Strings, numbers, tuples are immutable 
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, objects are mutable 
- Python garabage collection and variable calls are awesome and pretty cool :)
- Dictionaries are ordered starting Python 3.7
